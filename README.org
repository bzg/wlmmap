* What is Wlmmap ?

Wlmmap is the web application behind http://www.panoramap.org

All the data displayed on http://www.panoramap.org come from the
Wikimedia Commons database and are released under a free license.

* Core features

See http://www.panoramap.org

Users can display cultural heritage monuments for a country/language
on a map.

For example, you can display monuments from France in french or from
France in catalan: pick up the one you want from the menu, then click
"Show".

This will load data in a local copy of of the [[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Monuments_database][Wikimedia Commons
monuments database]], maintained by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Multichill][multichill]].

If you click on "Here", this will request the monuments database
directly, not the local copy, and display the results on the map.

* Implementation

Wlmmap is built on top of [[http://www.mapbox.com/][mapbox.js]] which relies on [[http://leafletjs.com/][leaflet.js]] to
display maps from [[http://www.openstreetmap.org][OpenStreetMap]].

The javascript part of wlmmap is compiled from the ClojureScript
(=.cljs=) file.

This =.cljs= file uses [[https://github.com/dribnet/blade][blade]], a ClojureScript wrapper for leaflet
and/or mapbox by [[https://github.com/dribnet][Tom White]] -- thanks to him for his [[https://github.com/dribnet/blade/issues/1][help]].

** Slow results?

The toolserver does not allow more than 5000 results, while countries
often have a lot more monuments.

So we stored a copy of the monuments database in a redis instance,
from which we can get faster results.  Then, since clustering >10000
markers takes long, we display monuments one by one instead, using the
experimental =core.async= Clojure library.

This (hopefully) leaves the UI reactive.

* Support

You can help by proposing patches for

- the localization;

- using =addLayers= instead of =addLayer= to bulk add markers to the
  markercluster (see https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster)

Thanks!
